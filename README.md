# ns-SpaceWire

Details are to come. In the early phase of development.

It operates at 10 mbps.
You need to add differential buffers.
Although post-route simulation was done you need to pay attention to the RxClk buffer.
A higher level controller is needed, that counts the credits and also initiates the FCTs and Nulls.

This design was done just for fun, overall it took days but total hours spent is around 12 hours.
